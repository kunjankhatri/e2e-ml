### Aim: Predict the MPG value for a vehicle, given that we have other attributes of that vehicle

### Steps to run:
1) Clone the repo from master branch
2) Create a virtual python environment
3) pip install -r requirements.txt in that environment
4) download the data( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG)
## To run locally uncomment line 62-63 in main.py
5) run: python main.py

## To check running app on AWS,
